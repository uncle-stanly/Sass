                Sass (short for  syntactically  awesome  style  sheets)
                is a preprocessor scriptinglanguage that is interpreted
                or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).SassScript 
                is the scripting language itself. 
            </p>

            <p class="p1">
                Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax,
                called "the indented syntax," uses a syntax similar 
                to Haml.It uses indentation to separate code blocks 
                and newline characters to separate rules. The newer
                syntax, SCSS (Sassy CSS), uses block formatting like
                that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and 
                semicolons to separate rules within a block. The 
                indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally 
                given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively. 
            </p>

            <p class="p1">
                SassScript provides the following mechanisms: variables, nesting, mixins, and selector inheritance.
